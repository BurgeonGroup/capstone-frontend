<p>Try this out: <code>draw_letter( "A" ); </code> and then run the program. What did the board show? Now try a different letter- maybe the first letter of your name! </p>

<p>You can spell words too. Try out this code: </p>
<code>
draw_letter( "F" );<br>
delay(1);<br>
draw_letter( "U" ); <br>
delay(1);<br>
draw_letter( "N" ); <br>
delay(1);
</code>
<p>Try spelling your first name! </p>
