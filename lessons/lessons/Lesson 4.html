<p>The board can do even more than twinkle. It can even write words! We are going to teach

you another function. This one is the print function. Unlike the twinkle function, the print

function always needs something inside the parenthesis. You have to pup quotes inside it

too. </p>

 

<p>Try this out: <code>print( 'A' )</code> and then run the program. What did the board show? Now try a 

different letter- maybe the first letter of your name! </p>

 

<p>Remember how you can have the computer do lots of things in a row by using a line for 

each command? That means you can write whole word! Try out this code: </p>

<code>print( 'F' ) </code><br>

<code>print( 'U' ) </code><br>

<code>print( 'N' ) </code>

 

<p>Try spelling your first name!</p>
