<p>When you changed the speed of twinkle in the last lesson, the color went back to normal

didn’t it? Well, you can tell the computer to twinkle a certain color and speed at the same 

time. Inside the parenthesis, put the speed first, then the color, with a comma in between. 
</p>
 
<p>
Try <code>twinkle(1, blue)</code> to make it twinkle slowly in blue.

<p>
Can you make it twinkle fast in yellow? What other speed and color combinations can 

you think of? Try them all out, and then go to the next lesson.</p>
