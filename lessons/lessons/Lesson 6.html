<p>Now maybe you want a little more control over each dot of light. </p>

 

<p>Here's a new function: <code>colorpixel()</code>.</p>

 

<p>Colorpixel will turn on one dot - called a "pixel" - in the color you want. To do this, you

needs to know 3 things:</p>

<p>The row your pixel is in (count down!) </p>

<p>The column your pixel is in (count across!) </p>

<p>What color you want it to be </p>

 

<p>Try this code out: </p>

<code>colorpixel (2, 3, green)</code>

 

<p>Make sure you use the commas in between each thing. This line will turn on the light two 

down and three over green. Now try changing the rows, columns, and color to see what 

happens. You can even try more than one instruction, one after the other. Just put each 

one on its own line. </p>

 

<p>What happens if you upload this code? </p>

 

<code>colorpixel(10, 3, red)</code>

<p>Nothing! There are only 5 rows, and that code tries to turn on a pixel in row 10 - which 

doesn't exist!</p>
