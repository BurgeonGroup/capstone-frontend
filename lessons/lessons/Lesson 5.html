<p>What if you want to show one thing on the board for a long time? We are going to teach 

you a new function to do that. The <code>wait()</code> function will make whatever is showing on the 

board from the line above it stay there.</p>

 
<p>
Try out this code:</p>

<code>print( ‘1' )</code><br>

<code>wait()</code><br>

 
<p>
Did the number 1 stay on there for longer? You can put a number from 1 to 10 between 

the parentheses to make it wait even longer. Try out this: </p>

<code>print( ‘X' ) </code><br>

<code>wait(10) </code><br>

<code>print( ‘Y' )</code>
