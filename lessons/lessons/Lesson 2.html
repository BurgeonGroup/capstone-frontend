<p>You can also change how fast the lights twinkle. You do this by typing the speed into the 

twinkle function. The speed can be between 1 and 10. </p>

 

<p>Try typing in <code>twinkle(5) </code></p>

 
<p>
That should look like the normal twinkle. What does it look like it you do it with a speed 

of 1 or 10?</p>
