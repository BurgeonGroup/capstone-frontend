<p>In the last lesson, you made the board light up. What if you want it to be a different color 

or go faster or slower? </p>

 
<p>
In programming, there are things called functions. You can tell if it's a function because

it is a word with parenthesis right after it, like twinkle(). You can tell a function to behave

differently by typing special instructions inside the parenthesis.
</p>
 
<p>
Tell the computer to make the board twinkle blue by typing twinkle(blue) and then

pressing the Run Program button.
</p>
 

<p>What happens if you use more than one line? Type </p>

<code>twinkle(red)</code><br>

<code>twinkle(yellow) </code>

 
<p>
Once the computer does what the first line says, it goes to the next line and does what 

that one says. Try making the program longer with even more colors! The colors you can 

use are: red, yellow, blue, purple, green, orange, and white. As always, make sure you 

type it right, or the computer won't understand!</p>
