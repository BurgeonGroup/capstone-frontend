Your lights only twinkled once? 
</p> 
<p>From now on, you'll have two places to put your instructions.</p>
            <ul>
           		<li>
            		Code in the <strong>setup</strong> box will happen once, when you first turn your tile on.
				</li>
				<li>
					Code in the <strong>loop</strong> will "loop," or repeat, over and over.
				</li>
            </ul>
<p>What do you think will happen if you write <code>twinkle</code> only in the loop box? (don't forget to click the upload button to try it out!)</p>
