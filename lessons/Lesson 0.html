<p>Welcome! We&#39;re glad you want to learn how to program! There will be a series of

lessons to teach you all the different parts of programming, and how you can use

programming to make the board light up.</p>

<p>Computers understand certain languages. We call these languages programming 

languages. Each separate line is a new instruction to the computer. You will type your 

instructions to the computer, called code, on the other side of the screen. </p>

<p>Get started by typing one line of code: <code>twinkle() </code></p>

<p>Now press the Run Program button on the bottom of the screen and see what the board 

does. </p>

<p>Did the board light up? Cool right? If it didn&#39;t work, make sure you typed it just like you 

saw it on this side of the screen. The computer is picky and only understands things when 

they are just right. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the first lesson! When you finish a lesson, press the Next button on the top.</p>
