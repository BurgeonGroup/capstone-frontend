# Capstone Front End

Program entry point is in the main.py file. All other source is in the src/
folder.


## Software Versions

I have been using Python 2.7.3 on my machine. And pylint 0.25.0.


## How to Contribute

Fork my repo. Make some changes. Commit. Repeat. When you are done submit a pull
request: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests

Also, run pylint on your source before committing it, and don't commit if pylint
returns warnings or errors (especially errors...). Try to fix them or leave a
comment if there is a good reason not to. Please try to follow conventions too
when reasonable. This is a very necessary tool when working with a language like
Python so our code does not crash in the middle of our demo ;)
